Brony Videos
------------

This app makes it easier to watch MLP Episodes (from Dailymotion) on Google TV devices.
(And also other Android Devices)

The dailymotion 'app' (its more like a mobile website) is not really optimized for Google TV.
This application uses the Dailymotion APIs to get the video information.
